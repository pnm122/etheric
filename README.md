A web application created for a Fiverr order using React as the frontend framework, GSAP and Locomotive Scroll for animations, and Firebase for the database, hosting, storage, and authentication. It serves as a gallery for the buyer's projects, featuring images, audio, and videos. It also has an admin panel, where a select group of admins can upload, update, and delete content from the gallery.
